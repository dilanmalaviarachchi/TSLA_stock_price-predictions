# TSLA stock price predictions
 This model is designed to predict the closing stock price of Tesla using a type of artificial neural network called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. 
 
Here's a simplified breakdown of the workflow:

Workflow Overview:
Install Necessary Libraries:

The code starts by installing several Python libraries (pandas_datareader, sci-kit-learn, Keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, alpha_vantage). These libraries are used for data processing, building the neural network, and fetching stock data.
Import Libraries:

The code imports the necessary libraries, including pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for plotting, and keras for building the neural network.
Fetch Tesla Stock Data:

The script uses the alpha_vantage API to fetch Tesla's daily stock prices. The fetched data is saved as a CSV file for future use.
Prepare Data:

The data is then transformed into a format suitable for training the LSTM model:
The stock data is reversed (so that the oldest data comes first).
A specific column ("close price") is selected for training.
The data is scaled to a range between 0 and 1 to improve the performance of the neural network.
The data is split into training and testing sets.
Build and Train the LSTM Model:

A sequential model is created using keras with LSTM layers.
The model is trained using the historical stock data to learn patterns that can predict future prices.
Make Predictions:

Once the model is trained, it is used to predict stock prices on the test data.
The predictions are then unscaled back to the original price range.
Evaluate Model Performance:

The code calculates metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
Visualize Results:

The actual and predicted stock prices are plotted to visualize the model's performance.
Predict Future Prices:

The model is used to predict future prices based on the last 60 days of stock data.
